Automate Hill Climb Racing Game Using Python | OpenCv, Mediapipe.

Hand gestures are super cool to use instead of keyboard keys!
So, I have used my Hand Gestures to play Hill Climb Racing game with the help of OpenCV library in Python.

I tried to take the most random game that we used to play during our childhood- "Hill Climb Racing Games" to a whole new level. Gesture-controlled gaming has always interested me and this is my silly contribution to that field. 
Using OpenCV, the screen is divided in such a way that the bottom left region of the screeen is used for applying breaks, whereas bottom right region of the screen is used for acceleration.


Controls
Right Hand Fist- Acceleration
Left Hand Fist- Break

Requirements
python 3.x
imutils
numpy
opencv-python


NOTE: No machine learning model is used for detecting objects!!
